Trip-Wire
Trip-Wire is a security system that utilizes various modules to detect intrusions and notify the user. The system is built using Arduino and integrates components such as a laser, light sensor, Bluetooth module, and more.

Modules Description:
Main Module: This is the primary module that integrates all other modules and executes them in a loop.

System Controller: Manages the overall state of the system, including intact, broken, and configure states.

Laser Controller: Controls the laser module and ensures it's turned ON.

Light Sensor: Checks the light sensor's received light intensity to detect any interruptions.

LED Controller: Manages the LED colors based on the system's state.

Bluetooth Controller: Controls the Bluetooth module to send notifications to a connected device.

Alarm Buzzer: Controls the alarm buzzer to sound an alert based on system state.

Keypad: Interprets the keypad inputs and manages the keypad buzzer.

Password Input: Manages the password input from the keypad.

Password Manager: Manages and verifies the entered passwords.

Buzzer for Keypad: Controls the buzzer to provide feedback when a key is pressed.
